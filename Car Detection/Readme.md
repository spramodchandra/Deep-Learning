This repository uses Yolo algorithm for object detection.
<br>
YOLO ("you only look once") achieves high accuracy while also being able to run in real-time. <br>
This algorithm "only looks once" at the image in the sense that it requires only one forward propagation pass through the network to make predictions. 
After non-max suppression, it then outputs recognized objects together with the bounding boxes.<br>
