This repository implements a Neural Style Transfer.
<br>
Neural Style Transfer merges two images, namely, a content image and a style image, to create a generated. 
The generated image G combines the content of the one image with the style of another image.
<br>
I used transfer learning for achieving this. Used a 19-layer version of the VGG network. This model has already been trained on the very large ImageNet database.
